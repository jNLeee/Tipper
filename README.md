Tipper offers a loading splash screen upon opening the app and functions by the user typing in their
initial total food amount. An adjustable scroll bar allows the user to decide how their dining experience
was and Tipper will calculate how much your final total cost including tip should be.

In the files, there is a screen capture video file called Tipper_DemoVideo.swf that gives an overview
of how the fully functioning app works in case the user can't try it out for themselves by using Android
Studio.
